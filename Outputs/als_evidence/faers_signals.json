    "POTASSIUM has adequate data (n=27) but shows perfectly neutral signal (ROR≈1.00)",
    "OLESOXIME, THREONINE, and PRIDOPIDINE have insufficient FAERS data due to lack of market approval or nutritional supplement status",
    "All q-values = 1.0 after FDR correction, indicating no signals survive multiple testing correction"

  "limitations": [
    "Investigational drugs (OLESOXIME, PRIDOPIDINE) have minimal FAERS exposure",
    "Nutritional supplements (THREONINE, METHYLCOBALAMIN) are underreported to FAERS",
    "ALS is rare (2024 reports in 20M total), limiting statistical power",
    "Lack of signal in FAERS does not rule out efficacy - most drugs lack sufficient real-world exposure data"
  ],
  "conclusion": "FAERS inverse signal screening provides minimal evidence for or against repurposing these candidates in ALS. METHYLCOBALAMIN shows a non-significant trend worth monitoring in future analyses. Clinical trial evidence and mechanistic data are more informative than FAERS for these investigational/nutritional agents."
