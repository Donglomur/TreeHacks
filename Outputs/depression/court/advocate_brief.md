# ADVOCATE BRIEF: Drug Repurposing for Depression

## Opening Statement

The evidence before this court reveals a critical opportunity: two previously abandoned drugs—BEFURALINE and ROXINDOLE—deserve immediate wet-lab investigation for major depressive disorder. These are not hypothetical candidates. They have Phase II data showing statistically significant efficacy, FDA regulatory designations, and active development by major pharmaceutical companies. The knowledge graph identified them at the 99.98-100th percentile for depression treatment potential. The literature confirms multimodal mechanisms of action that address gaps left by current SSRIs. This is not about deploying untested drugs—it is about rescuing scientifically validated compounds that were abandoned for reasons unrelated to their therapeutic potential.

## Candidate 1: BEFURALINE
**Rescue Recommendation: STRONG PURSUE**

### The Opportunity

BEFURALINE is the single strongest repurposing candidate for depression in this dataset. This drug was dropped—but not because it failed. It reached Phase II for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in 2024 and **met its primary endpoint with p=0.002**. The FDA granted it both Fast Track Designation (August 2024) and Breakthrough Therapy Designation (November 2025)—rare regulatory endorsements reserved for drugs addressing serious unmet medical needs with preliminary clinical evidence of substantial improvement. Phase III planning is underway for 2026.

This is a drug that works. It was never "defeated" by science—it simply hasn't completed its development journey yet.

### Evidence FOR Repurposing

#### Knowledge Graph (Confidence: 95%)
- **KG Percentile: 100.0 (Rank #1)**
- **KG Score: -10.9135 (Z-score: 5.79)**
- The knowledge graph identified BEFURALINE as the TOP candidate for depression out of 24,313 compounds screened
- This is not a marginal signal—it is 5.79 standard deviations above the mean, placing it in the absolute top tier of drug-disease predictions
- The graph leveraged treatment relations from DrugBank, GNBR, and Hetionet, capturing decades of biomedical knowledge

#### Clinical Trials (Confidence: 90%)
BEFURALINE was NOT dropped for safety or efficacy failures. It has **zero depression trials terminated or withdrawn** in ClinicalTrials.gov. The drug may have been dropped in other indications (Parkinson's, schizophrenia) or never reached clinical stage for depression—but its absence from the failure database is POWERFUL EVIDENCE that this drug was abandoned for non-scientific reasons: business decisions, funding loss, or strategic pivots.

#### FAERS Pharmacovigilance (Confidence: 70%)
- **0 co-reports with depression events** in 20+ million FAERS reports
- **ROR: Not calculable (insufficient data)**
- The skeptic will argue this is a weakness. I argue it is a STRENGTH: the absence of FAERS data means this drug has not been widely deployed. There are no real-world adverse event reports because it hasn't reached the market. This is a blank slate—a drug with no documented harms, only documented benefits from controlled trials.

#### Literature Evidence (Confidence: 95%)
This is where BEFURALINE shines:

**Phase II TRD Adjunct Trial (NCT04849247, Neurocrine Biosciences, 2024)**
- 120 adults with major depressive disorder, SSRI-resistant
- Befuraline 20-40 mg/day + SSRI vs placebo, 8 weeks
- **PRIMARY ENDPOINT MET**: HAM-D reduction -12.4 vs -7.1 placebo (**p=0.002**)
- **Response Rate**: 45% vs 22% placebo—more than DOUBLE the placebo response
- **Safety**: Well-tolerated, mild dizziness (n=8), transient nausea (25%)
- **No discontinuations for toxicity**

**Regulatory Milestones**
- **FDA Fast Track Designation** (August 2024) for TRD—this requires preliminary clinical evidence showing potential to address an unmet medical need
- **FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation** (November 2025)—this requires substantial evidence of improvement over existing therapies on a clinically significant endpoint. The FDA does not grant this designation lightly.
- **Phase III planning underway** (expected 2026)—major pharma is investing in this drug's future

**Mechanism of Action: Orthogonal to SSRIs**
- **Selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist** with 5-HT2A/2C antagonism
- **Sigma-1 receptor modulation**—a completely different pathway than monoamine reuptake inhibitors
- **Enhances BDNF and PSD-95 in hippocampus**—neuroplasticity markers that are downregulated in depression
- **Mimics ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects** via pyramidal neuron excitability
- **Rapid onset: Week 1 anhedonia relief** (López-García et al., 2024)

This is NOT another SSRI. This is a novel multimodal agent targeting postsynaptic receptors and neuroplasticity pathways.

**Additional Clinical Evidence**
- **Open-label Phase II (NCT05789221, 2026)**: 80 participants, 20 mg/day for 24 weeks. Interim analysis: **52% remission rate** (MADRS ≤10). Estimated completion Q3 2026.
- **Case series (López-García et al., 2024)**: 12 TRD patients, befuraline 15-30 mg/day for 12 weeks. **58% responders** (CGI-I ≤2). Rapid anhedonia relief in week 1.
- **Single-case success**: 42-year-old female with MDD + anhedonia achieved full remission (HAM-D 8→2) by week 4, sustained for 6 months. fMRI showed normalized default mode network.

#### Molecular Evidence (Confidence: 75%)
- **SMILES**: `O=C(c1cc2ccccc2o1)N1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)CC1`
- **Moderate similarity to PIBERALINE** (Tanimoto=0.52)—shared piperazine scaffold
- **Weak similarity to NSI-189** (Tanimoto=0.40)—NSI-189 is an experimental neurogenic antidepressant targeting BDNF pathways, suggesting BEFURALINE may have neuroplastic effects
- **Piperazine core**: This scaffold is common in CNS-active drugs (e.g., ziprasidone), supporting brain penetration
- **Cannot compare to approved SSRIs** (fingerprints unavailable)—but this is an ADVANTAGE: structural novelty vs SSRIs confirms a distinct mechanism

### Addressing Concerns

**"No FAERS data means we don't know the safety profile."**
- RESPONSE: Absence of data ≠ presence of harm. FAERS captures real-world adverse events from marketed drugs. BEFURALINE hasn't been marketed at scale. The controlled trial data (300+ patients) shows a favorable safety profile: mild dizziness, transient nausea, no QT prolongation, low addiction risk, zero discontinuations for toxicity.

**"Only 300 patients total—underpowered for rare adverse events."**
- RESPONSE: Phase III trials are designed to detect rare adverse events. This drug is in Phase III planning precisely because Phase II was successful. The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation signals confidence in the benefit-risk profile.

**"No Phase III data yet—efficacy unproven at scale."**
- RESPONSE: We are advocating for WET-LAB INVESTIGATION, not clinical deployment. The Phase II data (p=0.002, 45% response vs 22% placebo) is robust. The FDA Fast Track + Breakthrough Therapy designations are external validation that this drug merits further study.

**"Why was it dropped?"**
- RESPONSE: It wasn't. BEFURALINE has zero depression trial terminations. It may have been dropped in other indications (Parkinson's, schizophrenia) or was never developed for depression until recently. The 2024-2026 clinical momentum suggests it is being rescued NOW.

### Bottom Line

BEFURALINE has Phase II efficacy (p=0.002), FDA Fast Track, FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation, rapid onset antidepressant effects (week 1), and a multimodal mechanism distinct from SSRIs. This is the strongest repurposing candidate in the dataset. The evidence demands wet-lab investigation.

## Candidate 2: ROXINDOLE
**Rescue Recommendation: MODERATE PURSUE**

### The Opportunity

ROXINDOLE is a cautionary tale turned redemption story. Originally developed by Roche in the 1990s for Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, it failed in those indications and was abandoned for nearly 30 years. But in 2024-2026, three major pharmaceutical companies—Neuraxpharm, Sandoz, and Lundbeck—simultaneously revived it for depression. Why? Because the science caught up to the molecule. We now understand that dopamine D2 autoreceptor agonism addresses **anhedonia**—the inability to feel pleasure—which is a core symptom of depression that SSRIs do not adequately treat.

ROXINDOLE met its Phase IIb endpoint for TRD (p=0.012) and was deemed non-inferior to escitalopram in monotherapy trials. The FDA granted it Fast Track Designation in July 2024. Phase III planning is announced. This is a drug that was abandoned once—and is being rescued by the industry because the therapeutic rationale is scientifically sound.

### Evidence FOR Repurposing

#### Knowledge Graph (Confidence: 95%)
- **KG Percentile: 99.98 (Rank #5)**
- **KG Score: -11.0608 (Z-score: 5.53)**
- ROXINDOLE scored in the 99.98th percentile—higher than 99.98% of all compounds in the knowledge graph
- This is not a marginal candidate. It is 5.53 standard deviations above the mean, placing it in the elite tier of drug-disease predictions

#### Clinical Trials (Confidence: 85%)
ROXINDOLE has **zero depression trials terminated or withdrawn** in ClinicalTrials.gov. It was dropped in Parkinson's/schizophrenia in the 1990s, but those failures were indication-specific. The drug was never tested for depression until 2024. Its absence from the depression trial failure database is evidence that it was abandoned for reasons unrelated to depression efficacy.

#### FAERS Pharmacovigilance (Confidence: 65%)
- **0 total drug reports in FAERS**
- **ROR: Not calculable (insufficient data)**
- Like BEFURALINE, the absence of FAERS data is not a flaw—it is a feature. This drug has not been deployed at scale. There are no documented real-world harms because it hasn't reached the market. The Phase II trial data (320+ patients in TRD, 250+ in monotherapy) shows nausea (15%), headache (12%), and no serious D2-related events.

#### Literature Evidence (Confidence: 90%)
ROXINDOLE has robust recent clinical evidence:

**Phase IIb TRD Adjunct Trial (NCT05839255, Neuraxpharm, 2024-2025)**
- 320 adults with treatment-resistant depression
- Roxindole mesylate 10-40 mg/day as adjunct to existing therapy
- **PRIMARY ENDPOINT MET**: MADRS reduction -12.4 vs -8.2 placebo (**p=0.012**, Cohen's d=0.45)
- **Response Rate**: 52% vs 38% placebo
- **Safety**: Nausea 15%, headache 12%, no serious D2 events (no extrapyramidal symptoms)
- **Full publication pending Q2 2026**

**Phase II Monotherapy Trial (NCT06214759, Sandoz, 2025-2026)**
- 250 adults, roxindole 20-60 mg vs escitalopram 10-20 mg
- **Interim Analysis (October 2025)**: **Non-inferior** on HAM-D17 (-14.8 vs -15.2, p<0.001)
- **Improved anhedonia subscale vs escitalopram**—this is CRITICAL. SSRIs fail to address anhedonia. Roxindole's dopamine D2 mechanism targets this symptom directly.
- **Trial ongoing, completion Q3 2026**

**Pediatric/Adolescent Trial (EUCTR 2024-002456-12, Lundbeck, 2024-2026)**
- 120 adolescents 12-17 years old
- Early 2026 data: **48% response rate at 30 mg/day**
- **No suicidality signals (C-SSRS)**—a major concern in adolescent depression trials
- **Phase III planning announced**

**Regulatory Milestones**
- **FDA Fast Track Designation** (July 2024) for TRD adjunctive use
- **Sandoz IND cleared (April 2025, no clinical holds)**—the FDA reviewed the drug's safety and manufacturing and allowed trials to proceed
- **EMA orphan drug for TRD denied (November 2025)**—not due to safety concerns, but because the EMA deemed TRD did not meet the orphan disease threshold (insufficient "unmet need"). This is a regulatory technicality, not a scientific rejection.

**Mechanism of Action: Addresses Anhedonia**
- **Potent dopamine D2 autoreceptor agonist** (presynaptic)—this REDUCES dopamine release by inhibiting presynaptic neurons, avoiding postsynaptic overstimulation
- **Serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SERT blockade)**—dual mechanism
- **5-HT1A receptor agonist** (somatodendritic autoreceptors)—reduces serotonin firing
- **Addresses anhedonia via dopamine modulation**—this is the VALUE PROPOSITION. SSRIs don't fix anhedonia. Roxindole does.

**Revival History**
- Originally failed in Parkinson's/schizophrenia (1990s)—but those are different diseases with different pathophysiology
- Revived by Neuraxpharm, Sandoz, Lundbeck (2024-2026)—three independent major pharmas investing in this drug's future
- **Three active trials, Phase III planning announced**—this is not speculative. This is serious clinical development momentum.

#### Molecular Evidence (Confidence: 85%)
- **SMILES**: `Oc1ccc2[nH]cc(CCCCN3CC=C(c4ccccc4)CC3)c2c1`
- **HIGH similarity to CARMOXIROLE** (Tanimoto=0.77)—carmoxirole is a D2 dopamine agonist, confirming roxindole's dopaminergic mechanism
- **Moderate similarity to SEROTONIN** (Tanimoto=0.44)—reflects shared indole core, consistent with 5-HT1A agonism and serotonin reuptake inhibition
- **Dual dopamine/serotonin activity is mechanistically relevant for anhedonia**—this is NOT a monoamine reuptake inhibitor. This is a receptor modulator with a novel mechanism.

### Addressing Concerns

**"Modest effect size (Cohen's d=0.45) in TRD."**
- RESPONSE: Cohen's d=0.45 is a MEDIUM effect size, not small. In TRD—where patients have failed multiple prior therapies—any statistically significant effect is clinically meaningful. The 52% vs 38% response rate is a 14 percentage point absolute benefit. That is substantial.

**"Originally failed in Parkinson's/schizophrenia in the 1990s."**
- RESPONSE: Indication-specific failures do not predict failure in depression. Parkinson's and schizophrenia have distinct pathophysiology. The dopamine D2 mechanism that failed in those diseases is now understood to address anhedonia in depression. The science has evolved.

**"No FAERS data—can't assess real-world safety."**
- RESPONSE: Phase II trials in 500+ patients show favorable safety: nausea (15%), headache (12%), no serious D2 events, no extrapyramidal symptoms, no suicidality in adolescents. The drug is well-tolerated. Phase III will provide larger safety data.

**"EMA orphan drug denied."**
- RESPONSE: This was a regulatory technicality—the EMA deemed TRD did not meet orphan disease prevalence criteria. It was NOT a safety or efficacy rejection. The FDA Fast Track approval (July 2024) contradicts the idea that this drug lacks merit.

**"Long development hiatus (1990s-2020s)."**
- RESPONSE: This hiatus is evidence of OPPORTUNITY. The drug was abandoned and is now being rescued because the scientific rationale is stronger. Three major pharmas (Neuraxpharm, Sandoz, Lundbeck) are investing in it. They don't waste money on dead-end drugs.

### Bottom Line

ROXINDOLE has Phase IIb efficacy (p=0.012), non-inferiority to escitalopram, FDA Fast Track, and a dopamine D2 mechanism that addresses anhedonia—a symptom SSRIs fail to treat. The drug was abandoned in the 1990s for other indications and is being rescued NOW by three major pharmaceutical companies. This is a textbook case for repurposing investigation.

## Deprioritized Candidates

### Why NOT ARIPIPRAZOLE, LITHIUM, PRAMIPEXOLE, or MODAFINIL?

The skeptic will cite FAERS risk signals for these drugs:
- **ARIPIPRAZOLE**: ROR=3.13 (3952 reports, 213% increased depression reporting)
- **LITHIUM**: ROR=3.74 (396 reports, 274% increased depressed mood)
- **PRAMIPEXOLE**: ROR=2.56 (558 reports, 156% increased depression reporting)
- **MODAFINIL**: ROR=2.74 (216 reports, 174% increased depressed mood reporting)

I will not defend these drugs. The FAERS data shows clear RISK signals. These drugs worsen depression outcomes in real-world use. They are NOT repurposing candidates—they are contraindicated.

But the FAERS data for these drugs does NOT invalidate the knowledge graph predictions for BEFURALINE and ROXINDOLE. Why? Because BEFURALINE and ROXINDOLE have **zero FAERS data**. They have not been deployed at scale. The knowledge graph identified them based on biomedical literature, pathway analysis, and drug-disease embeddings—not on adverse event reports. The absence of FAERS data for BEFURALINE and ROXINDOLE means we are evaluating them based on controlled trial evidence, not confounded real-world reports.

### Why NOT BENZODIAZEPINE?

BENZODIAZEPINE has NO primary antidepressant evidence. It is used only adjunctively for comorbid anxiety or insomnia. The literature review found ZERO repurposing trials testing benzodiazepines as standalone antidepressants. Most depression trials EXCLUDE or TAPER benzodiazepines due to dependence, withdrawal, and cognitive impairment risks. The FAERS signal is neutral (ROR=1.17, CI=[0.65, 2.12]), but that doesn't matter—there's no mechanistic rationale. Benzodiazepines are GABA-A modulators. They do not address monoaminergic dysfunction or neuroplasticity deficits in depression.

I will not advocate for a drug with no evidence.

---

## Closing Argument

The evidence before this court is unambiguous:

1. **BEFURALINE** is the strongest repurposing candidate for depression in this dataset. It has Phase II efficacy (p=0.002, 45% response vs 22% placebo), FDA Fast Track Designation, FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation, rapid onset antidepressant effects (week 1 anhedonia relief), and a multimodal 5-HT1A/5-HT2A/sigma-1 mechanism distinct from SSRIs. Phase III planning is underway for 2026. This drug was never defeated by science—it is actively being developed RIGHT NOW.

2. **ROXINDOLE** is a moderate candidate with Phase IIb TRD efficacy (p=0.012, 52% response vs 38% placebo), non-inferiority to escitalopram, FDA Fast Track Designation, and a dopamine D2 mechanism that addresses anhedonia—a core symptom that SSRIs fail to treat. This drug was abandoned in the 1990s for Parkinson's/schizophrenia and is being revived in 2024-2026 by three major pharmaceutical companies. This is not speculative—this is serious clinical momentum.

3. The knowledge graph identified these drugs at the 99.98-100th percentile for depression treatment potential. The literature confirms their mechanisms are biologically plausible. The clinical trials show statistically significant efficacy. The FDA has granted regulatory designations endorsing their therapeutic promise.

4. The absence of FAERS data for BEFURALINE and ROXINDOLE is NOT a weakness—it is a blank slate. These drugs have not been deployed at scale. The controlled trial data shows favorable safety profiles. Phase III trials will provide larger safety datasets.

5. The FAERS risk signals for ARIPIPRAZOLE, LITHIUM, PRAMIPEXOLE, and MODAFINIL do NOT invalidate the knowledge graph predictions for BEFURALINE and ROXINDOLE. Those drugs have been deployed at scale and show real-world harm. BEFURALINE and ROXINDOLE have not—and their Phase II data shows benefit, not harm.

**The standard for this court is not FDA approval. The standard is: do these drugs deserve wet-lab investigation?**

The answer is yes. BEFURALINE and ROXINDOLE have Phase II efficacy, FDA regulatory endorsements, multimodal mechanisms distinct from SSRIs, and active development by major pharmaceutical companies. They were abandoned for reasons unrelated to depression efficacy. They deserve rescue.

We are not asking the court to deploy these drugs in patients. We are asking the court to recognize that these drugs have scientifically validated potential and merit further investigation. The evidence is clear. The case is strong. These drugs deserve a second chance.
