    "strongest_case": "TEMOZOLOMIDE - 91.4% FAERS protective signal (p=1.78e-12) is the strongest in the entire screen. Glioblastoma drug with alkylating mechanism applicable to BRCA-mutated breast cancers. NO breast cancer trials found - untapped opportunity. Mechanistic rationale: BRCA mutations create DNA repair defects that TMZ can exploit, potential synergy with PARP inhibitors. Main weakness: only 8 FAERS co-reports (small absolute number) and zero clinical trial data.",
    "second_best": "ETOPOSIDE - 90.1% FAERS protective signal with robust n=34 co-reports. TOP2A mechanism relevant to HER2+ breast cancer (TOP2A amplified in 5-10% of cases). Historical trials in 1980s-1990s showed 10-30% response rates but inferior to anthracyclines. Main concern: already tried and abandoned 30-40 years ago, secondary leukemia risk (1-3%), no commercial sponsor interest.",
    "third_best": "DASATINIB - 79.7% FAERS protective signal. SRC inhibition relevant to TNBC (SRC drives invasion/metastasis). Multiple Phase II trials (2008-2015) showed modest activity (ORR 4.7% monotherapy, 44% in combination) but did NOT lead to approval. Bristol-Myers Squibb abandoned breast cancer development ~2015. Main concern: failed Phase II trials, pleural effusions (10-30%), sponsor already walked away.",
    "key_limitation": "Breast cancer discovery yielded ZERO dropped/withdrawn drugs (all 30 candidates marked 'novel'). Many 'novel' drugs are actually FDA-approved for breast cancer (doxorubicin, paclitaxel, tamoxifen). The investigation focused on FAERS inverse signal screening to identify non-breast-cancer drugs with protective associations.",
    "molecular_limitation": "No SMILES data for most candidates in the discovery output. Molecular similarity and docking unavailable (NVIDIA API key not configured). Analysis based on known drug classes and mechanisms.",
    "literature_limitation": "Perplexity API key not configured. Literature findings based on known clinical trial history from ClinicalTrials.gov and mechanistic knowledge. Full literature search would provide citations and recent developments.",
    "breakthrough_finding": "FAERS inverse signal screening identified 3 non-breast-cancer drugs with strong protective signals: TEMOZOLOMIDE (91.4%), ETOPOSIDE (90.1%), DASATINIB (79.7%). This demonstrates FAERS utility for hypothesis generation in diseases where traditional repurposing approaches (dropped/withdrawn drugs) yield no candidates."

  "recommendations_for_court": {
    "advocate_focus": [
      "TEMOZOLOMIDE: Emphasize 91.4% protective signal (strongest in screen). Highlight alkylating mechanism similarity to cyclophosphamide (approved for breast cancer). Stress BRCA mutation prevalence in breast cancer (10-15% hereditary, 25% TNBC) creates synthetic lethality opportunity with PARP inhibitors. Emphasize NO breast cancer trials found = untapped opportunity.",
      "ETOPOSIDE: Emphasize 90.1% protective signal with robust n=34 co-reports. Highlight TOP2A amplification in HER2+ breast cancer (5-10% of cases). Stress FDA-approved drug with known safety. Argue for revisiting in anthracycline-refractory, TOP2A-amplified niche indication.",
      "DASATINIB: Emphasize 79.7% protective signal. Highlight SRC mechanism validated in TNBC. Stress Phase II trials showed SOME activity (44% ORR in combination). Argue for modern immunotherapy combinations (PD-1/PD-L1) that weren't available in 2008-2015 trials."
    ],
    "skeptic_focus": [
      "TEMOZOLOMIDE: Emphasize only 8 FAERS co-reports (tiny absolute number, possible statistical noise). Highlight zero breast cancer clinical trials = pure speculation. Stress BBB penetration (glioblastoma advantage) wasted in breast cancer. Question why no one has tried it if mechanism is so applicable.",
      "ETOPOSIDE: Emphasize this drug was ALREADY tried 30-40 years ago and FAILED to become standard. Highlight inferior to anthracyclines in head-to-head trials. Stress secondary leukemia risk (1-3%) unacceptable. Argue FAERS signal likely survivor bias (younger patients with other cancers).",
      "DASATINIB: Emphasize Phase II trials FAILED - Bristol-Myers Squibb walked away for a reason. Highlight 4.7% single-agent ORR is clinically meaningless. Stress 44% ORR in combination showed NO OS benefit. Highlight pleural effusions (10-30%) as severe quality of life impact. Argue if SRC inhibition worked, it would already be approved."
